TASK NO.01 
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting 
messages, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military 
communications. This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a 
fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter „A‟ becomes 
„D‟, „B‟ becomes „E‟, and so on. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher formed 
the groundwork for modern cryptographic techniques.
